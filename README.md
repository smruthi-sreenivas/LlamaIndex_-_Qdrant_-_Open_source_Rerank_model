# LlamaIndex_-_Qdrant_-_Open_source_Rerank_model

This project demonstrates how to build an advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using LlamaIndex, Qdrant vector database, and an open-source reranking model to improve retrieval quality. The system allows you to query PDF documents and get more accurate, contextually relevant answers by reranking retrieved chunks before passing them to the language model.
